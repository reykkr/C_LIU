Multi-Threaded Shared Counter with Mutex

The program creates two threads that concurrently increment a shared counter while ensuring thread safety using a mutex. The usage of a mutex prevents race conditions and ensures accurate results. The project showcases how to manage shared resources in a multi-threaded environment while maintaining data integrity.
