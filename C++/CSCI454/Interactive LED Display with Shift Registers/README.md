Interactive LED Display with Shift Registers

This project showcases an Arduino-based LED display that utilizes shift registers for efficient control. By cycling through a set of predefined patterns, the LEDs create visually appealing animations. The code demonstrates the correct use of shift registers and provides an example of how to control external hardware components using Arduino.
