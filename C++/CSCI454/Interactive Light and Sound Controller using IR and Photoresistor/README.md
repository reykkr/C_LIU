Interactive Light and Sound Controller using IR and Photoresistor"

This project combines infrared (IR) signal reception with a light sensor (photoresistor) to create an interactive system. When a specific IR signal is received, the system alternates between detecting ambient light levels using the photoresistor and producing sound through a piezo buzzer. This project showcases how various components can be integrated to create a responsive and dynamic sensory experience.
