Ultrasonic Sensor Display and Servo Control"

This project combines an ultrasonic distance sensor and a servo motor with a 7-segment display to create a versatile setup. The system measures distances using the ultrasonic sensor and displays the distance value on a 7-segment display. Additionally, the servo motor's angle is controlled based on the distance reading. The code integrates these components to showcase a dynamic interaction between sensors, actuators, and displays, providing a hands-on example of sensor-based control and visual feedback.
