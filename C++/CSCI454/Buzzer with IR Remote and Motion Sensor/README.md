Buzzer with IR Remote and Motion Sensor

This Arduino project integrates an infrared (IR) remote control, a passive infrared (PIR) motion sensor, and an RGB LED to create an interactive lighting system. The code enables users to adjust the LED's color using an IR remote while also responding to motion detection through the PIR sensor. The combination of remote control and motion-based activation adds an engaging and dynamic element to the LED lighting experience.
