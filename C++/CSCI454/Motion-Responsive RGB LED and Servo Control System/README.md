Motion-Responsive RGB LED and Servo Control System

This project involves an Arduino-based system that responds to motion using PIR (Passive Infrared) and IR (Infrared) sensors. Upon motion detection, an RGB LED switches to a red color and a servo motor activates. When motion ceases, the LED changes to green, and the servo deactivates. The project highlights sensor integration, dynamic LED control, and servo motor operation based on real-world events.
