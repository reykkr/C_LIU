Multiplexed LED Display with Shift Registers

This project showcases the construction of a multiplexed LED display using Arduino and shift registers. By sending data through shift registers, it drives a set of LEDs to display a sequence of numerical patterns. The code demonstrates the concept of multiplexing and how to control multiple LEDs efficiently with fewer pins, making it suitable for various applications like simple counters and digital displays.
