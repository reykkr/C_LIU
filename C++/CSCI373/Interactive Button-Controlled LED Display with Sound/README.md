Interactive Button-Controlled LED Display with Sound

This project showcases an Arduino-based system that uses buttons to control the illumination of different colored LEDs, each accompanied by a unique sound. Pressing the buttons activates corresponding LEDs and generates sound effects through a piezo buzzer. The code demonstrates how to create interactive and multi-sensory experiences using Arduino hardware and programming.
