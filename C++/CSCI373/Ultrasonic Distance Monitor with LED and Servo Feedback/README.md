Ultrasonic Distance Monitor with LED and Servo Feedback

This project utilizes an Arduino and an ultrasonic distance sensor to monitor the proximity of an object. The system employs LEDs to indicate the object's distance: a green LED lights up when the object is within a certain range, and a red LED is activated if the object is too close or too far. Additionally, a servo motor provides visual feedback by adjusting its position based on the object's distance. The project showcases the integration of sensors, actuators, and feedback mechanisms for distance measurement and object detection.
