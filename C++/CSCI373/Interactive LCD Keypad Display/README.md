Interactive LCD Keypad Display

This Arduino project combines an LCD display and a keypad to create an interactive interface. As users press the keys on the keypad, their input is displayed on the LCD screen. The code manages input from the keypad, printing it on the LCD, and automatically scrolling the content when the display area is filled. The project showcases how to build a basic interactive system using common input and output components with an Arduino board.
