Arduino Traffic Light Control System

This project involves creating a simple traffic light control system using an Arduino board. The program utilizes LEDs to simulate a traffic light sequence. A push-button acts as a trigger to start the traffic light cycle. When the button is pressed, the green light turns on for a set period, followed by yellow and red lights. The project introduces basic digital input/output handling on an Arduino and serves as a foundation for more complex traffic control systems.
