LED Animation with Shift Register

This project showcases the use of a shift register to control LEDs, creating an animated display. The Arduino code utilizes shift register ICs to control multiple LEDs, allowing for dynamic patterns and brightness adjustments. The code demonstrates the setup of the hardware pins and implements LED animations with gradual fading and shifting effects. This project provides insights into using shift registers for more efficient control of LED arrays in Arduino projects.
